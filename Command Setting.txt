1. Set up Sublime command line tool: subs

Website:

https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/osx_command_line.html

Steps:
(1)ln -s "/Applications/Sublime Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl" /usr/local/bin/subl
The /usr/local/bin is in the load path by default on OS X, so it's a much better place to symlink (create a symbolic link â€” or shortcut) that will allow you to run the subl utility from your Terminal app.


2. Changed Sublime command to run both javac and java

Steps:
(1) Preferences -> Browse Packages -> Java Folder -> JavaC.sublime-build
(2) Added this:
"cmd": ["java", "$file_base_name"],


3. Set up cs61b library:

(1)back to home directory

added the following two lines:
export CS61B_LIB_DIR="/Users/keyulai/Documents/cs61b/lib/*"
export CLASSPATH="$CLASSPATH:$CS61B_LIB_DIR:./"
(3)subl .bash_profile
added the exact two same lines
